# Intelligent-System-for-Missing-Child-Detection
This project presents a novel use of deep learning methodology for identifying the  reported missing child from the photos of multitude of children available, with the help of face  recognition. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a highly effective deep learning  technique for image based applications is adopted here for face recognition.
